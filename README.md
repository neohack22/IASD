Intelligence Artificielle et Science des Donn√©es # IASD

The repository tries to cover essential knowledge in artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data.<br>
It has been built with recognized specialists and researchers in these fields.<br>
The content of the program thus echoes the challenges of tomorrow that businesses will face.

The program stands out with a balance between two areas: massive data management and machine learning.<br>
It thus responds to the need of companies to ensure optimal communication within IA teams and to develop expertise in all of the stages constituting the data processing cycle in AI (Extraction, transformation, aggregation and analysis of often massive and originally unstructured data).<br>
The balance between these two themes is rare but the good integration of skills in these two areas is essential to carry out IA projects.<br>

Finally, an important part of the repository should also be devoted to the implementation (design and programming) of AI algorithms and their experimental analysis on computer clusters.

This is a work in progress #WIP.<br>

Therefore you can check for other folders in dedicated branches until they get merged.
