        "As we seek to deploy machine learning systems in the real world, it becomes critical that we examine not only whether the systems don't simply work \"most of the time\", but which are truly robust and reliable. Although many notions of robustness and reliability exist, one particular topic has raised a great deal of interest in recent years: robustness to adversarial examples. More precisely, can we develop classifiers that are robust to (test time) perturbations of their inputs, by an adversary intending to fool the classifier? \n",
